# Karma-game-
A game programming project I collaborated on at the University of North Texas

Requirements:
-Windows 8 or greater
-Direct X 11 or greater
-An adequate Graphics Card

How to Play:
Up arrow: Move forward
Down arrow: Move backwards
Left arrow: Strafe left
Right Arrow: Strafe right
'A' key: Rotate left
'D' key: Rotate right
'S' key: Get key

Navigate the maze and get the key. Avoid the demon - if he touches you, you lose! The suspenceful music gets louder when the demon is close. There is also a shimmering sound effect when you are near the key.
